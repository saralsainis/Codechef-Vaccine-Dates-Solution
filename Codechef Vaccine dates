Chef has taken his first dose of vaccine DD days ago. He may take the second dose no less than LL days and no more than RR days since his first dose.

Determine if Chef is too early, too late, or in the correct range for taking his second dose.

Input FormatFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, three integers D, L, RD,L,R.
Output FormatFor each test case, print a single line containing one string - "Too Early" (without quotes) if it's too early to take the vaccine, "Too Late" (without quotes) if it's too late to take the vaccine, "Take second dose now" (without quotes) if it's the correct time to take the vaccine.

Take second dose now
Too Late
Too Early
Take second dose now


Solution

for i in range(int(input())):
    D,L,R=map(int,input().split())
    if D<=R and D>=L:
        print('Take second dose now')
    elif D>R:
        print("Too Late")
    else:
        print("Too Early")
